# Web3

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/web3/web3.jpeg">

Unlike Web 2.0 applications, Web 3.0 eliminates the middle man. There’s no centralized database that stores the application state, and there’s no centralized web server where the backend logic resides.

Instead, you can leverage blockchain to build apps on a decentralized state machine that’s maintained by anonymous nodes on the internet.

## Components

* Frontend – UI/UX
* Smart Contracts – Logic 
* WASM / EVM – Virtual machine that runs the logic
* Blockchain – Infrastructure, e.g., Networking, Storage, etc.
